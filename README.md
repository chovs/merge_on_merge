# Append on merge

## Workflows

- Contributors create PRs with input files in specified folder e.g. `/input`.
- Github Actions run and create comment with output file change preview
- When merged, the output file will be appended, and input files will be moved to processed folder
- (Optional) The action could preview how the target file will look like after appending using comments within PRs.
